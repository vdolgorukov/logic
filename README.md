## File organization

### Builds portable, flat, static html files

This theme deliberately causes all the static HTML files to be generated in the root of the `_site` folder,
with no subfolders.

Ordinarily this might seem like a poor practice for organizing information,
but in this case it works well for the following reasons.

- There aren't that many HTML pages. With one page per chapter, even an enormous book will end up with only a handful of HTML pages.
- The theme provides a lot of structured metadata to make the page organization explicit and clear to search engines and other automated tools. The folder hierarchy isn't needed to convey this information.
- With a flat folder structure, the book can be reorganized without breaking existing links. Chapters can be reorganized, parts can be added and removed, titles can be changed, but as long as the `slug` stays the same, links continue to work.
- A flat folder structure allows browsing the generated HTML pages offline. Perhaps surprisingly, even static site generators typically create HTML pages that depend on some routing capabilities of a web server, and can't be run on a local file system. A flat HTML folder solves this problem magically.

### Chapter file names

Each chapter is written in its own [Jekyll page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/),
and stored in the [`_chapters/`](https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook/tree/master/_chapters) directory.

The file name of a chapter is never shown in the book---chapters 
are automatically numbered,
and the chapter name and link comes from the front matter `title` and `slug`.
The chapter file name is only used for determining the order of the chapters.
It should begin with a number and a dash,
so it appears in the correct order,
plus a name that makes it easy for you to identify.

For example:

```
_chapters/
    010-intro.md
    020-thesis.md
    030-antithesis.md
    040-conclusion.md
```

By using 3-digit numbers and incrementing them by 10 in this way,
we can easily reorganize files without having to rename them all.
For example,
we could add a "synthesis" chapter between "30-antithesis" and "40-conclusion" by prefixing it with a number between 30 and 40. 

```
_chapters/
    010-intro.md
    020-thesis.md
    030-antithesis.md
    035-synthesis.md
    040-conclusion.md
```

### Part directories

Chapters can optionally be grouped into "Parts",
by adding subdirectories to the `_chapters` directory,
and moving the chapter files into them.
Part directory names should begin with a number so they appear in the correct order,
just like chapters.
But unlike chapters, 
the directory name (without the numeric prefix) is also shown in the book as the part name. 

```
_chapters/
    010-thesis/
        010-overview.md
        020-blah-blah.md
    020-antithesis/
        010-underview.md
        030-blather.md
```

### Special parts for book front and back matter

Books typically include material at the front,
like a table of contents and introduction,
and material at the back,
like a glossary or index.
(In book publishing,
this is called "front matter" and "back matter",
not to be confused with the "front matter" variables in Jekyll pages).

This front and back matter is not included in the rest of the book's chapter and page numbering,
and it is never grouped into a "part",
even when the other chapters are.

To support this special material,
there are two optional special part directories:
`000-front/` and `999-back/`.
Chapter pages stored in these special part directories appear before or after the other parts,
and the chapters within them are not numbered.

```
_chapters/
    000-front/
        010-contents.md
        015-preface.md
        020-introduction.md
    010-thesis/
        010-overview.md
        020-blah-blah.md
    050-antithesis/
        010-underview.md
        030-not-blah.md
    999-back/
        010-references.md
```

The above would render as something like this:
- Contents
- Preface
- Introduction
- Part I: Thesis
  - Chapter 1: Overview of my thesis
  - Chapter 2: Blah, I say
- Part II: Antithesis
  - Chapter 3: Under the overview
  - Chapter 4: Not blah, I retort
- References

See a live site with multiple parts and front and back matter at
[fretboardfoundation.com](https://fretboardfoundation.com)
and its [_chapters/](https://github.com/jasongrimes/fretboardfoundation/tree/main/_chapters) directory.

### Part index pages

To add a dedicated page for a part,
with a subset of the table of contents for just the chapters in that part,
create a part index page.

In the part folder,
add a file named `000-index.md`.
Give it the following front matter:

```yaml
---
slug: your-part-name
layout: part
---
```

See an example [part index in the demo](https://jasongrimes.github.io/jekyll-chapterbook/theme.html),
and its source at [_chapters/010-chapterbook-theme/000-index.md](https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook/blob/master/_chapters/010-chapterbook-theme/000-index.md).

### Drafts and outlines

A chapter can be marked as a "draft" by renaming the file and adding `.draft` to the numeric prefix, like this:

    010.draft-introduction.md

Draft chapters are not listed in the table of contents,
and they are not included in the chapter numberings.
(To see in your dev environment how all the drafts _would_ be numbered if they weren't drafts,
set `show_drafts_in_dev: true` in [_config.yml](https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook/blob/master/_config.yml).)

But drafts _are_ listed in the book "outline".
This enables a workflow in which you start with an outline of your book,
made with empty draft chapters having just a `title` and maybe an `abstract`,
ordered and grouped into parts as needed (and frequently reorganized).

Then you can flesh out the chapters over time,
and when ready,
remove the `.draft` from the file name so it appears in the book.

See an [example draft chapter](https://jasongrimes.github.io/jekyll-chapterbook/draft.html)
and an [example outline](https://jasongrimes.github.io/jekyll-chapterbook/outline.html).

## Non-book pages

Your site will probably have other pages besides the contents of your book
(like an about page, a home page, etc.).

Create these like a regular Jekyll page and store them in the `_pages` directory.
In the page front matter,
set `layout: page` and make sure to set the `title` and `slug`.

```yaml
title: About this site
slug: about
layout: page
```

Then manually add links to the page using the slug.

Here's an [example of a non-book page](https://jasongrimes.github.io/jekyll-chapterbook/privacy.html).

## Home page

Create your site's home page at `_pages/index.md`,
and use `layout: home`.

```yaml
---
layout: home
title: Fretboard Foundation
subtitle: Practical building-blocks for intermediate guitarists.
---
```

If there is no `_pages/index.md`,
the `/README.md` will be used instead.

## Navigation

### Sidebar 

The book's automatically-generated table of contents is shown in the sidebar.

To show additional links above the table of contents in the sidebar,
define them in `sidebar_nav_top` in [_config.yml](https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook/blob/master/_config.yml).

```yaml
sidebar_nav_top:
- label: About this site
  url: about.html
```

To show additional links at the bottom of the sidebar,
define them in `sidebar_nav_bottom` in [_config.yml](https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook/blob/master/_config.yml).

```yaml
sidebar_nav_bottom:
- label: Privacy statement
  url: privacy.html
```

### Bottom of page 

To change the links shown at the bottom of every page,
define them in `bottom_nav` in [_config.yml](https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook/blob/master/_config.yml).

```yaml
bottom_nav:
- label: Home
  url: index.html
- label: Book
  url: book.html
- label: GitHub
  url: https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook
- label: Privacy
  url: privacy.html
```

### Breadcrumbs

To configure links to the book title page and table of contents in the chapter breadcrumbs,
specify the urls in `bookcrumbs` in [_config.yml](https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook/blob/master/_config.yml). Each item is optional; comment it out to disable it.

```yaml
bookcrumbs:
  book_url: book.html
  contents_url: contents.html
  book_icon: assets/gitbook/images/apple-touch-icon-precomposed-152.png
```

## Include "helpers"

In order for this theme to work natively with GitHub pages,
it can't use any custom Jekyll plugins.
But it _can_ do any logic and data manipulation supported by the template language, Liquid.

So this theme makes extensive use of Liquid templates to act as "helpers",
by including them in a page and passing them parameters using Jekyll's standard [`include`](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/) tag.

See [helpers in the demo](https://jasongrimes.github.io/jekyll-chapterbook/helpers.html) for details.

### Chapter links

The `chapter-link.html` helper renders a link to the chapter with the specified `slug`,
using its current title and chapter number.

For example:
{% raw %}
```
See {% include chapter-link.html slug="harmony-intro" %}.
```
{% endraw %}

Parameters:
- `slug`: Required. The `slug` of the chapter to link to.
- `anchor`: An optional anchor tag to append to the chapter link.

See an [example chapter link](https://jasongrimes.github.io/jekyll-chapterbook/helpers#chapter-links).

### Tables of contents

The `chapterbook-toc.html` helper allows you to make a table of contents page,
including chapter abstracts (if any).

Parameters:
- `show_drafts`: If `true`, also show draft chapters. Useful for showing an "outline" view of the book.

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% include chapterbook-toc.html %}
```
{% endraw %}

See an [example table of contents](https://jasongrimes.github.io/jekyll-chapterbook/contents.html) 
and [draft outline](https://jasongrimes.github.io/jekyll-chapterbook/outline.html) in the demo.

### Figures

The `figure.html` helper renders images as figures in the book.

Parameters:
- `url`: The relative URL to the image (appended to `site.baseurl`).
- `caption`: An optional caption to render beneath the figure.
- `class`: an optional `class` attribute to add to the the HTML `<figure>` tag.

See an [example figure](https://jasongrimes.github.io/jekyll-chapterbook/helpers.html#figures) in the demo.

### Theme variables

The `chapter-vars.html` helper sets a number of variables related to chapters and parts
which can be accessed in markdown files or Liquid templates.
It can also render the variables for inspection, 
to help with debugging.

Parameters:
- `id`: The `page.id` of the chapter page for which to set variables.
- `slug`: The `page.slug` of the chapter page for which to set variables (ignored if `id` is passed).
- `withnum`: For performance reasons, chapter and part numbers are not computed unless `withnum` is `true`. (To compute only chapter or only part numbers, set `withnum=part` or `withnum=chapter` instead.)
- `inspect`: If true, render the variables to the page, for debugging.

See [example chapter vars](https://jasongrimes.github.io/jekyll-chapterbook/variables.html) in the demo.

## Wide tables

Tables can be created using normal [GitHub-flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-). 

To prevent wide tables from breaking the book layout on mobile devices,
wrap them in a `<div>` directly in the markdown file, 
with `class="table-wrapper"` and the attribute `markdown="block"`.

See an example of [mobile-friendly wide tables](https://jasongrimes.github.io/jekyll-chapterbook/wide-tables.html) in the demo.

## References and citations

See [example citations and references list](https://jasongrimes.github.io/jekyll-chapterbook/references.html) in the demo.

## Extra CSS or javascript files

You can add extra CSS or JavaScript references in `_config.yml`:

- `extra_css`: for additional style sheets. If the url does not start with http, the path must be relative to the root of the site, without a starting `/`.
- `extra_header_js`: for additional scripts to be included in the `<head>` tag, after the `extra_css` has been added. If the url does not start by http, the path must be relative to the root of the site, without a starting `/`.
- `extra_footer_js`: for additional scripts to be included at the end of the HTML document, just before the site tracking script. If the url does not start by http, the path must be relative to the root of the site, without a starting `/`.

## Customizing font settings

The fonts can be customized by modifying the `.book.font-family-0` and `.book.font-family-1` entry in `./assets/gitbook/custom.css`.

```css
.book.font-family-0 {
    font-family: Georgia, serif;
}
.book.font-family-1 {
    font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```
